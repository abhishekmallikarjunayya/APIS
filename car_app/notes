-------------------------



This application is a basic **Car Information CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application** built using the **FastAPI** framework for the backend and **MongoDB** as the asynchronous database. The frontend is a simple single-page application using **HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript**.

Here is a summary of what the app does and how it was built:

***

## 1. What the App Does (Features) üöó

The app provides standard data management functionality for a list of cars:

* **View Car List (Read):** Displays all cars stored in the MongoDB database in a simple HTML table upon loading.
* **Add New Car (Create):** Allows users to input the Car Name, Company Name, Price, and Mileage, and save the data to the database via a **POST** request.
* **Edit Existing Car (Update):** Allows users to select a car from the list, pre-populates the input fields with the car's data, and sends the updated information to the database via a **PUT** request.
* **Delete Car (Delete):** Allows users to permanently remove a car entry from the database via a **DELETE** request.

## 2. How the App Was Built (Architecture) üõ†Ô∏è

The application follows a three-tier architecture:

### A. Frontend (Presentation Layer)

* **Files:** `index.html` and `style.css`.
* **Purpose:** Provides the user interface (form, table, buttons) and handles interaction logic.
* **Technology:** **HTML** for structure, **CSS** for styling, and **Plain JavaScript** to manage data fetching (`fetchCars`), form submission (`saveCar`), editing (`editCar`), and deletion (`deleteCar`).
* **API Interaction:** JavaScript functions make asynchronous `fetch()` calls to the FastAPI endpoints (e.g., `/cars/`, `/cars/{id}`).

### B. Backend (Application Logic Layer)

* **File:** `main.py` (FastAPI).
* **Technology:** **FastAPI** provides the web server and defines the API endpoints (routes).
* **Key Functions:**
    * **Routing:** Defines the endpoints for all CRUD operations (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
    * **Data Validation:** Uses the Pydantic model (`Car`) to automatically validate incoming JSON data from the frontend.
    * **Business Logic:** Calls the database layer (`database_mongo.py` functions) to execute the desired operation.
    * **Serialization:** Uses Pydantic's configuration (specifically `json_encoders = {ObjectId: str}` in `models.py`) to convert MongoDB's internal `ObjectId` into a standard string (`id`) before sending the JSON response to the frontend.

### C. Database (Data Layer)

* **Files:** `database_mongo.py` and `models.py`.
* **Technology:** **MongoDB** for data storage (a NoSQL document database) and the **Motor** library (asynchronous MongoDB driver) for communication.
* **Key Components:**
    * **`database_mongo.py`:** Contains the connection setup (`AsyncIOMotorClient`, `car_collection`) and the crucial `car_helper` function used to map the MongoDB document fields (especially `_id` to `id`) before they are returned as a list.
    * **`models.py`:** Defines the **Pydantic `Car` model**, which dictates the structure of the car data (name, company, price, mileage) and tells the application how to handle the `_id` field from MongoDB via the `alias="_id"` property.
